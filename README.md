# Library Management System

This program is a simple library management system implemented in C++. It allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, listing, and deleting them. The program saves the library data to a file so that it can be loaded again later.

**Compile the Program:** Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   
   --> g++ -o libraryApp main.cpp
   
**Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program in your PowerShell terminal.

--> ./libraryApp

Follow the Menu Options: Once the program is running, follow the menu options to perform various tasks:

Add Book: Enter details of the book to add it to the library.
List Books: View a list of all the books in the library.
Delete Book: Remove a book from the library by selecting its number.
